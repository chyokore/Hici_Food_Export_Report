# EU Market Penetration Risk Analysis for HiCi Ltd

Brief Description:
In response to the challenges posed by the European Union's stringent food safety standards, this project aimed to analyze and mitigate potential risks faced by HiCi Ltd, a local food export company, during its expansion into the EU market. As a Data Analyst for HiCi Ltd, I was tasked with extracting insights from raw data obtained from the EU Food Safety Standard Agency Portal. The primary objectives were to identify the highest risk factors, including the EU member country reporting the highest number of food rejections, the most rejected food items, the country of origin for the most rejected food, the types of actions taken against substandard food, and the most frequently reported origin (country) of food exports.

Impact:
The comprehensive analysis conducted through data visualization and pivot table creation provided actionable insights for HiCi Ltd. The outcomes of the project had a profound impact on strategic decision-making and risk mitigation strategies for HiCi Ltd's expansion into the EU market. By identifying high-risk food products, understanding the associated risks, and recommending a focused approach to management, the project aimed to enhance the company's preparedness and compliance with EU regulations.
